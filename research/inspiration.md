Being a consistent, disciplined, productive person feels way different than how most people think it does.
Even if you’re sitting in the cockpit of a jet and going at 500mph, it won’t feel like going fast because you’ve already acclimatized to the speed. It will feel like you’re just sitting still.

The same applies to being consistent, disciplined, and productive. In fact, a huge mistake that many of us make is that we judge ourselves for not being enough of these things because we assume it must feel like we’re not doing enough, not going fast enough.

The key to being highly disciplined is not just in disciplining yourself to push beyond your own limits, but also in disciplining yourself to slow down and allow the process of self-mastery to take as long as it needs to take to fully establish itself.

The key to being consistent is not in making one single attempt at habit-setting to become a success, but in a willingness to string together multiple attempts at habit-setting.

Being consistent, disciplined, and productive means being steady.

You are absolutely capable of this, you just need to make sure that you have a good plan that tells you what you’re doing, and when, and how to know if you’ve completed it successfully. You also need to trust that you are absolutely capable of making these changes in yourself if you’re willing to endure multiple failures and setbacks.

What is Productivity Coaching?
Imagine having someone in your corner who believes in you, supports you, sees your potential, and doesn’t allow you to bullshit yourself out of it. Someone who knows what it takes to set habits, routines, priorities, and plans. Someone who can teach you how to respect and appreciate yourself while at the same time expanding into higher levels of growth.

That’s what it’s like to work with a productivity coach!

I show people how to release friction out of their lives, stop procrastinating, overcome their fears, and get clear in their thinking. I show people how to resolve their anger, sadness, judgment, guilt, and instead become steady and solid.

It’s pretty awesome stuff. I this work, people have created businesses, grown their incomes, gotten promoted, got their shit done, learned to focus, go their habits in order, have begun enjoying things way more.
