# self control is fake 

In the self-improvement community, you often hear advices that often encourage pushing yourself to do more.

- Don't like doing a task? Do it anyway

- Have negative thoughts? Fight it back

- Thinking of taking a break? Screw that, that's for lazy people.

There are these advices being thrown around, and it's especially rampant in motivational speeches, and many other 'surface-level' self-improvement community.

But the thing is. Self-control is an illusion. To simplify, there are two parts of you. The one being the rational, thinking, and long-term part of you, and the other is the emotional part of you.

And you may think that the one responsible for making choices in life is the thinking rational part of your brain. But that's not true. Your emotional brain is the one making decisions.

When you say "I want to be productive for 3 hours today" and you were actually productive for 3 hours, that's not your rational brain making the decision. It's your rational brain convincing the feeling brain to make the decision. Similarly, when you say "It's ok, I can play games as a reward for today." This is thinking brain rationalizing your emotions.

In the end, your emotions dictate your decisions. And that's why forcing yourself, beating yourself up and yelling failure at yourself won't work. You'll just feel more negative emotions, which will hinder your ability to make proper decisions.

To sums things up, the more stable your emotion, the more you can make proper decisions that benefits you.

So, if coercing yourself to get things done will only result in worse results, then what should I do?

Get into emotional regulation. Learn about cognitive behavioral therapy, read a book about it, or go to see a therapist.

Procrastination is not a problem of self-control, it's a problem of emotional regulation.

I think a lot of people miss this important point. Everyone procrastinates for different reasons. Some fear success, while others fear failure. Some hate themselves, while others lack fulfillment.

There're are hundreds of self-help techniques to help with fears, guilt, sadness, loneliness, etc. But they're all problems of emotion regulation. You can have a universal technique for managing all these emotions. It's in CBT. (Look up daily record of dysfunctional thoughts)

What I think the difference between self-control and emotional regulation is

Your emotion is the one making the decision. You can think of it as your feeling brain driving the car, and you, the rational brain in the passenger seat. You can't control your direction, only convince your feeling brain to go in a specific direction.

By regulating your emotions, you are regulating the driver so he doesn't crash or get sidetracked too much. The rational mind can be in control, but most of the time, it's the emotional brain in control. So 'self-control' is not that accurate because you're really not in control—that's why I call it emotional regulation—because it's more accurate.

And I think that's why we end up binging youtube for the whole day or eating a tub of ice cream, especially if you coerce yourself by saying 'I'm lazy' or 'There's something wrong with me.' Because by doing that, you're only making yourself more emotionally unstable, which makes the driver—your emotional brain—drives more recklessly.

But hey, that just depends on your definition of self-control. I'm only referring to the masses definition of self-control—that you need to beat your emotion to submission to be productive.
