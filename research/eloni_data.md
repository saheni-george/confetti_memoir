# Dying of the forest


I come from Senapati, a very small village nestled in the picturesque hills of Manipur. During my childhood days, we would frequently visit my mother’s garden where she would work till the sun was high up in the sky then she would call us to rest under the shade of a big tree and we would share a cup of tea along with what we locally call levü (a packed lunch made of rice and stew or chutney). It was more like an adventure as we got to notice a variety of flora and fauna. One can often see alluring insects making their way home or hunting for food. On the other hand, a bird chirping in the distance as the sun begins to set on the horizon. During the monsoon seasons, the cicadas would never stop buzzing. Dwelling back into the past now, it was a fascinating experience. The balance of nature and people created a beautiful harmony with the insects and animals humming alongside. 

However, after completing my graduation, I was home and I decided to visit my mother’s garden. It was surprising to see how the peacefulness had changed. The sun seemed to be hotter, days even warmer and the hot winds blew across your face making it humid and damp. I found fewer insect friends to be photographed. On asking my mum why the vast lands were cleared she mentioned that due to new settlements in the village, the land has been divided to accommodate new families for jhuming cultivation to provide sustenance and basic income. Upon delving deeper I came to understand that Jhum cultivation has been deeply rooted in the cultural traditions of the indigenous communities living in the northeastern states. The practice is not merely an agricultural technique but a way of life, deeply intertwined with the cultural fabric of hill people.

 
Jhum Cultivation in Manipur: Tradition, Challenges, and Future

In the lush, rolling hills of Manipur, a state nestled in the north-eastern corner of India, an ancient agricultural practice continues to shape the landscape and lives of its people. Jhum cultivation, also known as slash-and-burn agriculture or shifting cultivation, has been an integral part of Manipur's hill communities' culture and agriculture tapestry for centuries. This traditional method of farming not only provides sustenance but also forms the backbone of cultural identity for many tribal groups. It signifies a traditional and religious heritage for the conservation and sustainable use of resources for their livelihood. The tribal communities encompass a diverse set of traditional knowledge and practices to preserve the indigenous vegetation and resources available in the area. However, as Manipur faces the challenges of modernization and environmental conservation, the practice of jhum cultivation stands at a crossroads. This article delves into the intricacies of jhum cultivation in Manipur's hill regions, exploring its significance, impacts, and the delicate balance between tradition and sustainability.

## What is Jhum Cultivation?

Jhum cultivation is an age-old agricultural technique widely practised in the hill regions of Manipur, particularly by tribes such as the Kuki, Naga, and Mizo communities. This method involves clearing a patch of forest, burning the vegetation, and then cultivating crops on the cleared land for a short period before moving to a new area, allowing the previous plot to regenerate.

In Manipur, jhum cultivation has deep historical roots, dating back several centuries. It has evolved as an adaptive response to the steep terrain, heavy monsoon rainfall, and dense forest cover characteristic of the region. When one notices smoke in the hills of Manipur, it signifies the onset of the Jhuming season.


## The Process of Jhum Cultivation in Manipur

The jhum cycle in Manipur typically follows a well-defined pattern:

1. **Site Selection**: Farmers choose a suitable forest patch, often on hillsides, based on traditional knowledge of soil fertility and forest age. The farmers prefer gentle slopes rather than steep slopes to avoid soil erosion risks. Testing of the soil is done by looking for dark loose soil and the presence of earthworms indicating good fertility. 

2. **Clearing**: During the dry season (usually January to March), the selected area is cleared of vegetation. This is done using machetes and hoe or with the help of mechanised brush cutters.

3. **Burning**: The cleared vegetation is left to dry and then burned, typically in March or April. A process which allows the release of nutrients into the soil specifically enriching the soil with ash which helps in neutralising the soil thus maintaining the pH balance of the soil.

4. **Planting**: With the onset of monsoon rains in May-June, a diverse array of crops is planted. Fields are separated into many parts where a slope gradient is involved using unburnt wood or bamboo. This is done to avoid over running of rain water and preserve the nutrients in the soil.

5. **Crop Selection**: Farmers typically follow varieties of farming practices. They preferably adhere to mixed cropping where on a patch of land different varieties of crops are grown to sustain the diversity of crops. This ensures meeting the marketed surplus and marketable surplus. The crops commonly grown are Cereals (Rice, Maize), vegetables, Legumes and ground cover crops such as crucifers to decrease pest infestations. Fruit trees such as Lemons and mangoes are grown alongside the boundaries of the land which act as shelter belts to avoid crop damage from wind.

6. **Harvesting**: Crops are harvested from August to December, depending on their growth cycles. The practice of mixed cropping allows the farmers to continually harvest crops one after the other hence ensuring market supply and also generating income for the families year round.

7. **Fallow Period**: After cultivation, the farmers leave that plot of land fallow for several years to allow forest regeneration and soil fertility restoration. They move to a new plot of land abandoning the old one.

8. **Accessibility**: The site is reasonably close to the village for easy access. It is usually accessible by roads making the transportation of the produce easier to be delivered to the local markets and individual homes.

In Manipur, the traditional jhum cycle used to span 10-20 years. However, due to increasing population pressure and land scarcity, this cycle has been reduced significantly to 3-5 years in many areas, raising concerns about sustainability. In the long run, this can pose a threat to agricultural productivity and long-term environmental health. This can cause disruptions in the ecosystem balance resulting in risks of increased soil erosion.

## Cultural and Social Significance

For the hill communities of Manipur, jhum cultivation is more than an agricultural practice; it's a way of life that shapes social structures, cultural traditions, and communal bonds. The entire process, from site selection to harvest, is steeped in rituals and community participation.

In many tribal communities, the chief or village elders play a crucial role in deciding jhum sites and allocating plots to families. This system reinforces traditional leadership structures and communal land ownership patterns. The clearing and burning of jhum sites often involve entire village communities working together, fostering social cohesion and maintaining the cultural fabric of the society.

Traditional knowledge about forest ecosystems, soil types, and crop varieties is passed down through generations, preserving a rich repository of ecological wisdom. Songs, dances, and festivals associated with different stages of jhum cultivation form an integral part of Manipur's cultural heritage.

## Ecological Impact

The ecological impact of jhum cultivation in Manipur is a subject of ongoing debate among environmentalists, policymakers, and local communities.

**Positive Impacts:**
- Maintenance of forest mosaics and diverse ecosystems
- Preservation of indigenous crop varieties and agrobiodiversity
- Carbon sequestration during fallow periods

**Negative Impacts:**
- Huge loss of forest cover hence reduction in the biodiversity of the species found in that area, particularly with shortened fallow periods.
- Soil erosion on steep slopes, exacerbated by Manipur's heavy monsoon rainfall leading to flash floods and extensive soil erosion in the hilly tracts.
- Potential loss of niche species in areas of intensive cultivation due to habitat destruction.

    
    
    
    



The impact largely depends on the length of the fallow period. Traditional long fallow cycles (15-20 years) in Manipur were generally sustainable, allowing for forest regeneration. However, with the population booming the current trend of shorter cycles raises concerns about long-term ecological viability.

## Economic Aspects

Jhum cultivation plays a crucial role in the economic landscape of Manipur's hill regions:

- It provides food security for many rural households, with diverse crops ensuring a varied diet.
- Some jhum products, such as ginger, turmeric, and chilli, are sold in local markets, providing cash income.
- The practice requires minimal external inputs, making it accessible to resource-poor farmers.

However, economic challenges persist:
- Low productivity compared to settled agriculture
- Limited market integration due to remote locations
- Increasing pressure to shift to cash crops, potentially compromising food security

## Pros of Jhum Cultivation in Manipur

1. **Adaptation to Terrain**: Jhum cultivation is well-suited to Manipur's hilly topography where mechanised farming can become challenging due to inaccessibility.

2. **Biodiversity Conservation**: Traditional jhum practices maintain a mosaic of habitats, supporting diverse flora and fauna.

3. **Cultural Preservation**: The practice keeps alive traditional knowledge, customs, and social structures of Manipur's tribal communities.

4. **Low Input Costs**: Jhum requires minimal external inputs, making it accessible to resource-poor farmers.

5. **Crop Diversity**: Multiple crops are grown together, ensuring dietary diversity and resilience against crop failures.

## Cons of Jhum Cultivation in Manipur

1. **Deforestation**: Shortened fallow periods are leading to increased forest loss in some areas of Manipur.

2. **Soil Degradation**: Intensive cultivation on steep slopes can lead to soil erosion and fertility loss.

3. **Low Productivity**: Yields are generally lower compared to settled agriculture, particularly with shortened fallow periods.

4. **Conflict with Conservation**: Jhum practices sometimes clash with forest conservation efforts and protected area management in Manipur.

5. **Economic Limitations**: The practice offers limited opportunities for market integration and economic growth.

## Government Policies and Interventions

The government's approach to jhum cultivation in Manipur has evolved over time. Initially, policies focused on discouraging the practice, viewing it as detrimental to forests.The general shift in population and increasing demands of food products have created more land to be subjected to Jhum cultivation. However,recent approaches recognize the cultural significance of jhum and aim for a more balanced strategy. The government can work out schemes beneficial to the general public which can fall in economic activities such as farm diversification in the form of growing cash crops (fruits and non-fruits crops), keeping livestocks, poultry, fisheries, piggery, adopting integrated farming practices and non-farm activities such as weaving, carpentry, handicraft that can act as important supplementary sources of livelihoods.

However, the skewed distribution of infrastructure such as road, transportation, market, post harvest handling, and power in the tribal villages are found to be the main impediments for diversification and commercialisation which really increased the cost of disposition. This can be bridged by improving infrastructure, appropriate research and extension methodologies, access to land and credit markets, information, support to institutional building (market information systems, standards and grades, trade associations) are all different ways to lower transaction costs.


Current initiatives include:
- The North Eastern Region Community Resource Management Project (NERCORMP), which promotes sustainable jhum practices.
- Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States, encouraging transition to permanent horticultural crops.
- National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, supporting soil health management and water conservation in jhum areas.

However, implementation challenges remain, including limited reach in remote areas and the need for more culturally sensitive approaches.

## Sustainable Alternatives and Modifications

Several sustainable alternatives and modifications to traditional jhum are being explored in Manipur:

1. **Agroforestry**: Integrating tree cultivation with crops to maintain forest cover and provide additional income. It refers to sustainable land management where trees and crops go hand in hand. This can effectively mitigate the environmental impact of Jhum cultivation.

2. **Terracing**: Constructing terraces on hillsides to effectively curb soil erosion and soil water runoff incorporating more nutrients to the soil that is to be taken up by the plants.

3. **Improved Fallow Management**: Introducing nitrogen-fixing plants during fallow periods to enhance soil fertility. Leguminous crops can be grown during the fallow period. Once the flower initiation starts they can be incorporated back into the soil hence maintaining the soil fertility and the microorganisms essential for soil nutrition.

4. **Contour Hedgerow Systems**: Planting hedgerows along contours can reduce erosion. It provides biomass for soil improvement by pruning effectively which can act as mulch material for the soil reducing water loss and enriching the soil with essential nutrients.

5. **Alternative Livelihood Options**: Promoting activities like bee-keeping, mushroom cultivation, and ecotourism to reduce dependence on jhum and focusing more on income generation for the tribals.

## Case Studies

1. **Ukhrul District**: Some villages have successfully integrated large cardamom cultivation with traditional jhum, improving incomes while maintaining forest cover.

2. **Churachandpur District**: A community-led initiative has introduced terracing and agroforestry, significantly reducing the area under jhum cultivation.

3. **Senapati District**: Women's self-help groups have spearheaded the adoption of organic farming techniques in modified jhum fields, accessing niche markets for organic produce.

These case studies demonstrate the potential for sustainable adaptations of jhum cultivation in Manipur, balancing tradition with ecological and economic needs.

## Future Outlook

The future of jhum cultivation in Manipur lies in finding a balance between cultural preservation, ecological sustainability, and economic development. Key considerations include:

- Recognizing and incorporating traditional ecological knowledge in land-use policies.
- Promoting research on improved jhum techniques adapted to Manipur's specific conditions.
- Developing market linkages for jhum products to improve economic viability.
- Ensuring community participation in decision-making processes regarding land use and conservation.
- Establishment of cold storage to avoid crash in prices during bulk season

The path forward requires a nuanced approach that respects the cultural significance of jhum while addressing environmental and economic challenges. By combining traditional wisdom with modern scientific knowledge, Manipur has the opportunity to develop a sustainable model of hill agriculture that could serve as an example for other regions facing similar challenges.

## Conclusion

Jhum cultivation in Manipur's hill regions stands at a critical juncture, embodying the complex interplay between tradition, ecology, and development. While the practice faces significant challenges, it also holds valuable lessons in resilience and adaptation. As Manipur moves forward, the key lies in fostering a dialogue between traditional practitioners, scientists, policymakers, and conservationists. Jhum cultivation has been an age-old traditional farming practice securing a cultural tie in the lives of the farmers. It has not become just a way of survival but also a cultural legacy that has been passed down from generations to help them meet their basic food prerequisite for many years in the borderline districts of Manipur. So, it is hard for the farmers to adapt to new technologies all at once, but with time they are changing slowly. By valuing the cultural heritage of jhum cultivation while innovating for sustainability, Manipur can forge a path that honours its past while securing a sustainable future for its hills and people.
