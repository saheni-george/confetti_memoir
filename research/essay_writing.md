# Essay Writing

First, the rough idea is to have an Intro-thesis-body paragraphs-conclusion kind of structure. 

Now take the word count and split it up as: 
**Introduction** - 10% in which you state the point/aim of the essay and what is it you are going to argue. See, here you introduce your topic and hold your thesis statement. ==Your thesis statement contains your main points==

**Argument** - 80% broken across 3-4 main points. Here we have the different body paragraphs which explain the points in the thesis statement. The transition from one point to the next should be smooth and easy in a logical way. Being unable to do this results in a messy and choppy essay.

**Conclusion** - 10% statement about what your argument proves/disproves or any other inclusivities. This paragraph sums up the entire essay. It will be similar to the intro but goes into more detail. Make sure to end the essay with a good sentence and never do it abruptly. 

## Types of Essays 

There are three basic kinds of essays. 
1. Essays that argue or try to convince the reader of a point or an idea 
2. Essays that dive into the history or function of a topic
3. Essays that list the qualities or requirements of a topic 

The basic structure of writing any of the above essays would be like :
1. Introduction - This is the section where you can say something which will get the attention of the reader. You could connect that interesting statement with the topic and thereafter state the thesis which is the argument/perspective of your essay and how you are going to be about it. 
2. Point 1 - Define the topic clearly, cite history or relevant context and or cover it in a list of related ideas 
3. Point 2 - defend the thesis by explaining why you are right or explain where current research is with the topic or go into detail with the second idea in your list
4. Point 3 - Explain the points conflicting with your thesis and consider where this topic might move forward or cover the third idea in your list 
5. Conclusion - This part is crucial because here is where you give the reader the reasons to care about your ideas by explaining it's personal relevance for them or the world at large. Tie everything back to your thesis statement.

Before beginning the essay, write down the points for the essay. Create a detailed rough outline of your approach and then keep adding until you have the actual paras. 

Move ahead by writing your introduction and at least a rough idea of how your conclusion is going to be. But before this get the main points of the essay down first then go back to write the conclusion and introduction. This will make the essay sound more cohesive.

Try to generate a good title at the end of it all. It should be simple and direct telling your reader what they are going to see in the essay. Going the creative way is good too but if you are pressed for time a simple statement or question will work just as well.


## What about longer writing?

The above is for shorter writing formats where actual paragraphs are written. For longer essays or even longer dissertations, this changes significantly. 

For the introduction, you could state what your overall purpose/hypothesis/point/moral or thesis is and briefly explain the points you are going to make to back them up. Then you will go into each point one by one and give them their paragraphs or sections. Wrap up the paragraphs with a conclusion at the end. In the conclusion, restate the points you have made and also restate the main thesis statement. 

There are more advanced rules for large bodies of written works but they all follow this basic outline. You could have an entire section for introduction which can be made up of various sub-sections which would provide background information, establish a methodology etc. Then you could have a section that dives into your first point followed by sections for each point that you will bring up in support of your thesis statement. A conclusion will follow them. The structure is the same only expanded to a larger scale. 

Another idea is to have mini-essays within the larger essay. As for point 1, you could turn that into an essay of its own with its sub-points or supporting arguments while serving also as major Point 1's points. Point 1's section can also have its intro and conclusion. 

This will primarily work for persuasive writing or debates. Know the rules of essay writing and then be creative about how you can break them to get the reader's attention and keep it to the end. It is vital you know the rules for knowing what it is and why will help you in knowing how to use it or change it to suit the style of writing that you are creating for that particular work. 

==If it is graded work, perhaps be more conservative for teachers probably do not want you breaking the rules even intentionally.==

## How do you structure an argument

Always structure your argument on the PEE framework. 

Background - Provide background for the question asked 

Point - Describe the point that you are arguing or giving context 

Evidence - What evidence do you have to support the above arguments just made, make the case here 

Evaluation - As a result of your point, what does this mean for the wider thrust/issues of the essay? Your thesis is the exploration of the way an author uses a particular theme or narrative device. At this point, you would explain why the point you've just made supports your overall argumentation around the author's use of the theme.

Putting this all together, 

Point 1:

The author uses the relationship between A and B to reinforce the idea of love through the story. This can be evident from the language or pictures depicted by the author. Language then creates a strong feeling of connection or being together showing fraternal love and familial responsibility. 

Point 2:

This environment is used to great effect to increase the stakes of the story when A must save B from monster X. This makes the reader empathise with A's decisions and inclinations. The author's motive is to make the reader understand how vital love is to the human decision-making process and the way we live our lives. 

In the end, all points should be supported by evidence and then a further reason as to why you made the point in the first place and how it links with the essay's title/thesis statement. 

### Outlines 

Create an outline to keep your writing organised and help arrange ideas and topics around. This is the basic "equation" for the essay. Turn this messy outline by filling it with sentences/paragraphs so that the essay will have a final form.

==research on the different ways to outline a written piece==

==research on the different types of essays with different formatting==

==look at academic resources, college-level textbooks==
