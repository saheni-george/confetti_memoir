# What you mean to me

I love to sit and watch the lights of the town at night. I love to find a place to do nothing but look at the lights turn on one by one when the night falls. Like what we were doing last night, sitting on the terrace and staring at the lights of the town far away while you wept your heart out at the tiny inconsistencies in our life.

That is what I love about towns and cities at night. Every time that I felt alone or lonely, I sit and watch the day fade into dusk and people turn on their lights one by one. In such moments, I know I will not be afraid, nor will I be lonely for I can see the thousands of sources of light around me. That is a trace of a human. When a light turns on, you know that someone was behind that spark to dispel the darkness of night.  You know that a person put the light there, someone else switched it on and that someone is there now. That is a beautiful code to believe in the world for it defines our human spirit.

A simple message - I am also here and you are not alone in the darkness.

And that is what you make me feel. That is how I feel when I am with you.

I once read an old story when I was a small boy. A little boy asked his father what kind of girl he had wanted to marry, his father gave him a small piece of paper with a list on it. When the boy read the list, it happened to describe his mother to the tiniest detail

I never thought too much about the story as I did not believe such romance would exist in real life. But as I grew older and maybe a bit wiser, I started to make a complicated list of my own. I have a theory about growing up. For me, that is simply the process of finding a preference for everything. How do you like to spend your Sundays? How do you arrange your table, what do you feel about religion, what are the kinds of clothes you prefer and perhaps most importantly which kind of person do you want to grow old with. So, this kind of list grew in my head and has been for a long time. It was not like I went around looking for someone who fit the rough list I had in my imagination. I sometimes compare an interesting person to the list, but I never thought what happened to the lucky father in the story would happen to me.

Then I met you.

It has been years now and I am madly in love with you. I never imagined you would fit the list I had in my head but you just did slowly and surely. It just feels so easy to be with you. It is easy because you are everything that I wanted and somethings that I never knew I wanted until I found them in you. You know what to do and say that we never waste time arguing about what we should have done. You correct me gently when I become overconfident and look out for me when I might get into trouble. You just are the exact same way I wanted my partner to be. It is that easy.

It is so comfortable that I wonder how lucky I am to have found someone like you who fits the eccentric list - my list with too many criteria. And then I think how chance favoured me to actually meet you in life. I looked back at all the important decisions in my life that led me towards you. I was so close to never meeting you and thus missing out on you so many times.

People ask me - do I believe in God - the old me would have said perhaps. But I want to change my answer now for He has led me to you. Luck and chance would never make anyone so fortunate as He has made me today.
