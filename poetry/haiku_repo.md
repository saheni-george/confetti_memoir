# Rough notes on Haiku and poets

## taken from Classic Haiku - a Master’s selection- Yuzuru Miura**


## poets

**Ancient Greats** - Basho, Buson, Issa 
**Modern Greats** - Shiki, Kyoshi, Dakotsu 

The Japanese Haiku is a ==microcosm (regarded as encapsulating in miniature the characteristics of something much larger)== composed of seventeen syllables. Within this miniature world, these poets can express diverse feelings and thoughts, randomly capturing peeks of eternity through the ephemeral and the commonplace. William Blake could also see entire worlds in the palm of a hand, and the Cosmos in the wildflowers by the roadside. 

### Spring

Amidst the grassland
Sings a skylark 
Free and disengaged from all things.

==*Matsuo Basho* (1644 -94) elevated Haiku to an art form. One critic called him a **Wordsworthian figure** who sought a mystical union with nature.
The rapidly growing popularity of Haiku throughout the world has caused him to become internationally known.==

A spring day - 
A long line of footprints
On the sandy beach. 

Suna-hama ni
Ashi-ato nagaki
Haru hi Kana 
   
Double cherry blossoms 
Flutter in the wind
One petal after another. 

Hito-e zutsu
Hito-e zutsu chire 
Yae-zakura 

**NB** - double cherry blossoms are deeper in colour and bloom later than normal.

==Masaoka Shiki (1867 -1902) had tuberculosis in his youth and was invalid. He spent the rest of his life devoted to literature and writing (essays, haiku and tanka). His contribution to haiku was writing of **shasei** or sketches from life.==

Spring rain-
A thrown-away letter
Windblown in the grove. 

Haru-same ya
Yabu ni fukaruru
Sute tegami 

In my deserted home village 
The old cherry tree 
Now in bloom 

==Mikagirishi==
Kokyo no sakura 
Saki ni keri.

==Kobayashi Issa (1763-1827) born in Shinano (Niigata) was the first son of a farmer. Upon the death of his mother, his father remarried. The stepmother was cold to him and Issa struggled with family troubles all his life. He left Shinano at 14 and moved to Edo (Tokyo) to study Haiku. His style of writing is down-to-earth and has animal images.==

==Kagami Shiko (1665-1731) was one of the ten major disciples of Basho. He wrote the first critical essay on Basho and is credited with popularising his work throughout the country.==

==Oshima Ryota (1718-87) sought a return to the original style of Basho in writing Haiku from the witty urbane style.==

Mountain cherry blossoms
Against the snowy peak -
Silent harmony in heaven.

### Summer

Calm and serene
The sound of a cicada
Penetrates the rock.

Are now buried
Glorious dreams of ancient warriors.

The sound of a waterfall 
Heard from far and near.

Take the shape of a demon 
Then change into the Buddha.

Oh, evening swallow!
My heart teems with cares and anxieties
About tomorrow.

And the fresh greenery 
Bring back memories of bygone days.

### Autumn 

An autumn eve-
An hour of leisure 
In a fleeting life.

Rising winds
Rock and roll
Gauzelike, white bush clover.

Act as the grave keeper
After I’m gone.

Against the bright full moon
A hilltop pine tree
Is the image of my rebirth.

Is calm and resigned 
As I tread on the fallen leaves.
