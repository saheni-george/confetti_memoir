# missing 

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.

Write, for example, 'The night is starry
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.

Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.

She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.
The night is starry and she is not with me.

This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night whitening the same trees.
We, of that time, are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.

Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.
Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.

Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer
and these the last verses that I write for her.

Tonight, I sit alone in the quiet of the fields.

The stars, steadfast and cold, flicker beyond the reach of my hands. The wind moves through the trees with a sound like memory, a low hum across the valley, as if the earth itself is grieving.

Tonight, I can say it plainly: she’s gone. I loved her, once, in the way one loves an old path, worn by footsteps, known by heart. She loved me too, or perhaps we shared only a season.

On nights like this, I held her close, our bodies warmed by the firelight, the land quiet around us, bearing witness. We made promises we couldn’t keep beneath a sky too large to contain us.

She loved me then, in her own way, and I loved the calm in her eyes, as steady as the hills that cradle this place.

Tonight, I sit in her absence. The fields stretch out under the same stars, but they seem farther now, the silence deeper.

I hear the song of an owl in the distance, its call rising through the trees. I listen, but there is no answer.

She is gone, and the earth continues on without her. The moonlight lays itself across the land, as it has done for centuries, indifferent to my loss.

None of it matters now. The fields still grow green, the wind still whispers through the trees, but she is not here to walk with me.

This is what’s left. The long quiet of the land, the steady turning of the seasons. Her absence fills the space where she once stood, and yet the soil beneath my feet feels unchanged.

The same night. The same hills rising like shoulders against the sky. But we are no longer the same.

I no longer love her, at least not as I once did. But I remember how I held her, how love held us together, briefly, like the bloom of wildflowers in a summer field.

Her voice is gone now, faded into the quiet rhythm of the days, like the echo of footsteps on a well-worn trail.

She belongs to someone else now, as the earth belongs to no one, yet gives itself freely to those who walk upon it.

Her hands, her voice, her eyes— they’ve passed into the world beyond my reach, as all things must.

I no longer love her, but maybe I still do. For love, like the seasons, is short-lived and inevitable, but forgetting—forgetting stretches out like a long road through the valley.

Through nights like these, the land remains the same, but my soul—oh, it still carries her, quiet and unresolved.

This will be the last sorrow she brings me, and these, the last words I will write for her, though the earth will keep its own record, in the turning of the leaves, in the quiet of the fields.

Tonight, I can write about the way she’s gone.

Outside, the streetlights flicker like tired lungs, and the city hums—something between a lullaby and a siren. The stars? They’re just airplane lights now, moving too fast to mean anything.

Tonight, I’ll say it out loud: she’s not here. I loved her, once, in the way you love a song on a scratched CD—skipping but still playing. She loved me, sometimes. Maybe in the gaps between. Or maybe we were both just trying to fill the silence.

Through nights like this one, I held her close. I kissed her forehead like a promise I couldn’t keep because who can hold onto anything in a world that moves this fast?

She was here. And now she’s gone. How could I not love the way she stayed still while everything else blurred by?

Tonight, I can feel the absence. It’s 2 AM, and the neon signs blink outside my window, casting their glow over everything but her.

I hear the hum of an Uber pulling away, a dog barking somewhere, and it feels like the city is swallowing itself.

I reach for her like a text I forgot to send, but she’s gone, lost somewhere in the pixels of memory.

The night presses down, heavy as a mattress after too many nights without sleep. And still, she’s not here.

None of it matters now. The playlist keeps looping, but the songs don’t hit the same. She’s just not with me anymore.

This is what’s left. A half-empty room. A street corner. The faint sound of someone laughing—maybe her, but probably not.

My fingers swipe through old photos like trying to catch smoke. My heart scrolls back, but she’s not in the feed.

The same night. The same streetlights buzzing. But we’re not the same anymore.

I don’t love her. Not now. But the way I loved her then—it clings to me like the smell of her perfume still caught in my hoodie, folded in the corner of the room.

Her voice used to hang in the air, a missed call I couldn’t return. Now it’s just static.

She’s someone else’s now. Her laughter, her body, her eyes—bright like phone screens in the dark.

I don’t love her anymore. I swear. But sometimes, I think, maybe I do.

Because love’s like that, isn’t it? A notification you can’t clear. It flashes for a second, then stays with you longer than it should.

Through nights like these, when the city won’t sleep, I keep replaying her in my mind, and my soul— well, it’s still buffering.

This is the last thing I’ll say about her. The last text I’ll write but never send.

And maybe, just maybe, I’ll mean it this time.

Tonight, I can write about her absence.

I sit here, beneath the electric hum of the ceiling fan, and the sky, though empty, feels vast and endless.

The night moves through me like an old vinyl record, the soft scratch of the needle—a distant song playing from nowhere.

Tonight, I can write about how she is gone. I loved her once, in a way you love something fleeting, like the last train slipping out of sight. She was real, wasn’t she? Maybe not entirely.

In nights like this, she was here—her warmth pressed against my chest. I held her as if holding a secret no one would ever know.

She loved me, or maybe she was just passing through. How could you not love someone with eyes that always seemed a little far away?

Tonight, I can feel her absence. I reach for her, but there’s only empty space, like a city I once lived in but can’t quite remember.

The night outside is larger than me—larger than this. I hear the world breathing, indifferent.

And yet, here I am, writing as if these words could build a bridge back to her. But she is nowhere, like a misplaced memory.

It doesn’t matter that she’s not here. The world keeps turning in its quiet, mechanical way, and I remain, trying to make sense of something that slipped through my fingers.

This is the truth. Somewhere, someone else is living her life now. Somewhere, she is a dream that never needed me.

My mind searches for her as if retracing old steps on unfamiliar streets, but I know those paths have long since vanished.

The same night. The same wind. But we are no longer the same people.

I don’t love her anymore, not really. But how could I forget the way her presence once filled the room?

Her voice drifts in the air, faint, like a half-remembered song. She was always drifting, wasn’t she? Like a story half-told.

She belongs to someone else now, as she did before, as she will again. A part of me knew this was inevitable.

Her voice, her hands, her faraway eyes—they were always a little out of reach.

I don’t love her anymore, but maybe I still do. Love is a brief moment. The act of forgetting—well, that lasts forever.

Through nights like this, I still see her shadow across the window, and my soul, foolish as ever, refuses to let go.

This will be the last time I remember her. The last time I write anything for her. Or maybe that’s just something I tell myself.
