* Avalon Landing: Avalon as a place where we go after death. Arthur's sword was forged on this island. The King was taken to this very island after being grievously wounded in battle. The idea for using this name comes from the film - *Finding Forrester*, the metaphor of finding what one wants from life in the most unexpected of places and with the most unexpected of men and women.
