# another idea

There’s this place in my mind where time doesn’t move, where the sun always dips low, casting a gold-edged halo around everything it touches. The sky is wide, stretched out like a canvas above us, and there’s a stillness in the air, the kind that makes you think nothing bad could ever happen. That’s the day I keep coming back to, the one that’s stayed lodged in my memory like a favorite song, always playing softly in the background. 

It was before everything fell apart, before the cracks in our world grew too wide to cross. You wore your gray turtleneck sweater, the one you always reached for on days when the air had that crisp edge of fall. It framed your face in a way that made your eyes softer, brighter. I can still picture you sitting there, legs tucked under you, head tilted slightly, looking out over the grassy meadow that unfolded in front of us like some kind of postcard we’d accidentally walked into. 

Milo was there, too, our dog, darting between patches of wildflowers, his tail wagging like he didn’t have a care in the world. His joy was contagious, and I remember you laughing, that laugh that I’ve only ever heard from you, the one that felt like the sound of something untouched by time. We sat on the blanket, the sun already sinking lower in the sky, casting everything in that golden light that makes even the ordinary feel significant. 

My parents were there, along with your mom, laughing together, sharing stories that wove into the atmosphere like threads of sunlight. They seemed so far away, though they were only a few feet from us, their laughter mixing with the sounds of the evening. My sister was there too, talking to her boyfriend, their voices barely above a whisper, already planning the lives they would build together. And then there was us, sitting in the middle of it all, like we belonged there, like nothing could ever pull us apart. 

The rhododendrons with their red blooms lined the edge of the clearing, their flowers bright and alive against the green backdrop. I remember thinking how perfect it all felt, how even nature had conspired to give us this one day, a day that would stand still, untouched by everything else that life would throw at us later.

We built a fire as the sun began to slip behind the hills, the soft crackle of the wood grounding us in that moment. You leaned against me, your head resting on my shoulder, and for a while, we didn’t say anything. There was no need for words; the silence spoke louder than anything we could have said. I remember your hand in mine, warm, familiar, and in that moment, I believed—really believed—that nothing could ever take this from us.

We took photographs, lots of them. You insisted on capturing every detail, every small smile, every time Milo ran past us in a blur of fur and happiness. I can still see you, holding up the camera, the sunset framing you in a way that made you look ethereal, almost like you weren’t fully part of this world. You were always good at finding beauty in the ordinary. I wonder now if that’s what made me fall in love with you in the first place—the way you could make even the simplest moments feel important, feel like they would last forever.

We stayed there until twilight, the fire burning low, the sky darkening into shades of blue and purple. I remember us whispering to each other, the words small promises—ones that felt real, solid in that fleeting moment. "We’ll come back here," you said, your voice soft but full of certainty. And I nodded, agreeing, believing that we would. "We’ll always have this place," I whispered back, thinking that somehow this memory would be enough to carry us through anything.

But we never did come back. Life doesn’t allow for returns, not really. The affair happened not long after, an invisible crack that spread silently at first, then all at once. I can still feel the weight of the silence that followed, the questions, the looks in your eyes as you tried to understand, to forgive. But forgiveness doesn’t always come when we ask for it. You tried—God, how you tried—but there are some things that can’t be undone. No matter how much we wanted to, we couldn’t go back to that meadow, to that day, to the people we were then.

And yet, that day lives on. It’s still there, perfectly preserved in my mind, like a photograph you keep on a shelf and glance at from time to time. In that memory, we’re still together. You’re still laughing, wearing that gray turtleneck sweater, Milo is still chasing after the setting sun, and our families are still laughing in the distance. The fire is still crackling softly, and the promises we whispered still feel real.

I think that’s the thing about memories. The worlds we build in our heads—they’re perfect, untouchable. Nothing bad ever happens in those worlds. In that version of our lives, there’s no affair, no arguments, no tear-filled nights where we don’t know how to talk to each other anymore. In that world, we stayed, we made it. You never had to try to forgive me because there was nothing to forgive. We’re still sitting by that fire, watching the sun go down, believing that this—this perfect day—would never end.

But in this world, the real one, we drifted. The space between us grew too wide, and no matter how much we reached for each other, we couldn’t close it. You said goodbye in a way that was soft, almost imperceptible, as if you were slowly letting go, inch by inch. And I knew, even as we tried to hold on, that the part of you that had once loved me had already left. You were standing there, but you were also already gone.

And now, I have to let go too.

We live in different worlds now, you and I. You’ve moved on, maybe even found peace in a place I couldn’t follow. And I’m here, still carrying that day with me, still holding onto the memory of you in that gray sweater, the sun dipping low in the sky, the fire burning between us. I think I’ll always carry it. 

But that’s okay. In the end, maybe that’s the best we can hope for—that the worlds we’ve built in our memories will stay with us, perfect and unchanging, even as the real world continues to shift and move on without us. You’ll always be in that meadow, the light catching in your hair, Milo running beside you. And I’ll be there too, beside you, just as we were before everything else came between us.

That was the perfect day, and in my mind, it always will be.

## version 2

There’s a version of you that still sits beside me on that hillside, the air cool as the sun dips below the horizon, painting everything in hues of gold and pink. You’re wearing that grey sweater, the one you always stole from my closet, a little too big for you, the sleeves covering your hands. Milo is there too, running in wild circles, kicking up dust, his ears flapping as he chases nothing in particular. His joy is simple, pure, the kind that made us laugh without thinking.

I can see it all so clearly still—my parents and your mom sitting on the wooden bench we dragged out there, their laughter mixing with the sounds of the evening. They seemed so at ease that day, like the world had paused just for us, gifting us this perfect moment. My sister sat a little apart, talking quietly to her boyfriend, their heads close together, lost in their own bubble. And there we were, in the center of it all, surrounded by the people we loved, the golden light wrapping around us like a soft blanket.

We took so many photographs that day. I remember watching you tilt your head slightly, that small, thoughtful smile on your face as you framed the perfect shot. You always had an eye for details, for the small, beautiful things others would miss. We joked about how we were becoming “that couple,” always documenting everything. But deep down, we both knew why. We were trying to capture something we knew was fleeting, trying to freeze a moment in time that we could keep forever.

And in a way, we did. Those photos still exist, stored somewhere, untouched. But the version of us in those pictures? That’s not who we are anymore, is it? They’re just ghosts now—snapshots of a time that’s long since passed. The real you, the one who walks the streets of some other city now, living a life that no longer intersects with mine, is as distant to me as a stranger. Maybe it’s because life has its way of pulling people apart, of wearing down the connections we thought were unbreakable. 

But the version of you that lives in my mind, in the world I’ve created there, she’s still perfect. She’s still sitting beside me in that oversized sweater, her hair falling into her eyes as she brushes it away absentmindedly. We’re still on that hill, with the sun casting everything in that golden light, with Milo chasing shadows, and our families laughing in the distance. In that world, nothing has changed. The love we shared is untouched, the conversations are never awkward, the silences never heavy. It’s all exactly as it was, preserved in some quiet corner of my mind, like a dream that never quite fades.

The real world, though—it’s different. You’ve grown, changed into someone else. I’ve seen glimpses of that new you, through stray words and old photos on social media, but she’s not the girl I once knew. And maybe that’s okay. Maybe we’re supposed to grow apart. But it doesn’t stop me from missing the version of you I carry with me, the one that will always be young and laughing, forever caught in that sunset with me. 

In the real world, people move on, grow into new versions of themselves. But in the worlds we hold inside our heads, everything remains as it was. Perfect. Untouched. As long as those worlds exist, the people we loved never really leave us. They’re always there, suspended in time, in the moments we choose to hold on to. And I’ll carry you with me in that world until the day I die.

## version 3

I still see us,  
sitting on that hill, the light soft,  
your sweater draped over me,  
too big, sleeves swallowing my hands.  
Milo runs circles in the grass,  
wild and free,  
while your family and mine laugh  
in the glow of the evening.  
Your sister’s voice, a quiet hum in the background,  
her words lost in a conversation  
I’ll never hear again.  

We were happy there, weren’t we?  
In that small, fleeting moment,  
before the world shifted,  
before we became something else,  
something distant.  
I remember how you looked at me,  
as if that moment could last forever.  
And maybe, for a while, we believed it could.  

But I’ve walked far from that place now.  
The girl I was then,  
the one who laughed easily,  
who reached for your hand without thinking,  
she isn’t me anymore.  
The world has pulled us apart,  
in ways I can’t explain,  
in ways that don’t need explaining.  
I am someone new,  
someone different,  
and you no longer know her.  

Yet I know there’s a version of me  
you still carry—  
that girl in the grey sweater,  
smiling in the golden light,  
forever young,  
forever in love.  
You hold her close, don’t you?  
In some quiet corner of your mind,  
she stays.  
She hasn’t changed.  

And maybe that’s where she belongs—  
in the world you’ve kept safe,  
where time can’t touch her,  
where I will always be the girl you loved  
on that warm, fading evening.  

But I’ve let that girl go,  
let her rest in the past,  
where she belongs.  
And maybe, one day,  
you will too.

## version 4

I remember you still,  
beneath the soft light of a fading sun,  
the hills quiet, Milo at our feet,  
and the earth was gentle, forgiving.  
Your grey sweater hung loose on your frame,  
your smile, small as a secret,  
rested on the air like a leaf that refused to fall.  
We sat there, hands brushing,  
as the world went on—  
our parents laughing,  
my sister whispering love to a boy.  
In that moment, we were whole,  
untouched by the years that would follow.  

But the days wear on us differently.  
Time has a way of changing things—  
the shape of your face,  
the rhythm of your words.  
You walk now in a world I do not know,  
your steps a little farther from mine,  
while I sit here, still on that hillside,  
still watching the sun sink low.  

In the world I’ve kept, you remain—  
still in that sweater,  
still smiling at the camera,  
your hair catching the last light of day.  
You are perfect there,  
as things are when untouched by time.  
And though the real you walks away,  
the one I hold stays close,  
forever in that golden hour.  

We build these worlds inside us—  
small, quiet places  
where the ones we loved never change,  
where the moments that mattered  
remain unbroken,  
where the sun never quite sets.  
And I will keep that world,  
its doors closed against time,  
until I, too, am gone.
